### **Notes**
- The YouTube playlist must be set as public in order to work.

- The application will only support up to 50 songs.

- The application has a bug caused by an Internal Server Error ([Response Status Code 500](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)).  The bug will cause some songs from the YouTube playlist to not get converted into the Spotify playlist.  This bug is random and not consistently reproducable.  There is no information on how to fix this as of yet.

- YouTube songs also may not be found on Spotify due to the difference in music libraries or titles.

- Must provide your own YouTube API Key, Spotify Client ID, Spotify Client Secret, and Spotify API Access Code for this bot to function.
